# Exhausted Monster Spawners

.. is a [Forge] mod for Minecraft 1.20.1. It's forked from [Enhanced Mob Spawners]'s
outdated and unsupported Forge branch, but has been gutted and rewritten to the point
where barely any of its code remains.

Most importantly, it aims to do the following:
- Limit the number of mobs that can spawn from a spawner.
- After all mobs have been spawned, the spawner becomes empty and inactive.
- Destroying it may drop spawn eggs depending on amount of remaining mobs.
- Spawn eggs can also be used to "refill" the spawner.
