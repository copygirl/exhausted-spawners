# Exhausted Monster Spawners

.. is a [Forge] mod for Minecraft 1.20.1.  
It's based on [enhanced-mob-spawners].

It aims to do the following:
- Limit the number of mobs that can spawn from a spawner.
- After all mobs have been spawned, the spawner becomes inactive.
- Destroying the spawner has a chance to spawn eggs.
- Spawn eggs can be used to recharge the spawner up to its limit.  
  The spawner must be inactive or currently spawning the same mob type.  

Intended to be used with [KubeJS] or similar to let mobs drop spawn eggs on death.
